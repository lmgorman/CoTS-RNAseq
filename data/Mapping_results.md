## Mapping Results for genome indexes
Genome indexes:
A. hyacinthus
P. lutea
P. evermanni

For all the Porites samples they all mapped better to P. evermanni genome versus P. lutea
(P. evermanni genome was taken from colonies in Moorea so unsuprising, still doesn't mean samples are from P. evermanni)

All samples (Acr and Por) have > 1 million total mapped reads
Only one sample (Por eaten; 34R) has < 1 million primary mapped reads 
 (Primary mapped reads = Number of reads mapped without multiple or chimeric aligments (i.e. the most reliable ones))[Mapping_120325.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19208834/Mapping_120325.xlsx)
